(french) on the migration to PostgreSQL using Foreign Data Wrappers, or FDW.
This was an opportunity to present to the general public the &lt;a href="https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/db_migrator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>db_migrator&lt;/code>&lt;/a>
extension for which I wrote an &lt;a href="https://fljd.in/en/2023/07/28/on-the-road-to-freedom-with-db_migrator/">article&lt;/a> on this blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While working on this workshop, we noticed that copying data with the
&lt;code>db_migrator&lt;/code> extension is not perfectly supported. Indeed, although there is a
low-level function to distribute the transfer table by table over several
processes, many situations will require writing a large number of SQL queries to
get out of trouble. Over the following months, I worked on the design of an
&lt;a href="https://github.com/fljdin/fdw-assistant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assistant&lt;/a> written in PL/pgSQL whose purpose is to simplify the generation
of these queries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On the road to freedom with db_migrator</title><link>https://fljd.in/en/2023/07/28/on-the-road-to-freedom-with-db_migrator/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://fljd.in/en/2023/07/28/on-the-road-to-freedom-with-db_migrator/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the past months, I have spent several weeks contributing to the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/db_migrator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">db_migrator&lt;/a> extension. Written solely in PL/pgSQL, it enables the migration of
schemas and data from a database system to PostgreSQL using the external data I
had presented &lt;a href="https://fljd-in.translate.goog/2021/07/16/parlons-un-peu-des-donnees-externes/?_x_tr_sl=fr&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=fr&amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few years ago&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, I present the functionality of the tool, its philosophy, and
the reason I found for its existence, even though it joins the ecosystem of
well-established open-source projects in the migration landscape. How does it
compare to &lt;a href="https://ora2pg.darold.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ora2Pg&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://pgloader.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pgloader&lt;/a> in terms of value and capabilities?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
