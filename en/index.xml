and PITR in PostgreSQL, although they were crucial in data durability. A better
understanding of these concepts would have helped me in a previous life, to be
more confident during a backup configuration and, well, during after-crash
intervention!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By reading this post, I will come back to an amusing file that used to be a
topic of discussion over the past decade: the backup label file. What is it and
what is it used for? How has it be enhanced from its origin with PostgreSQL 8.0
and what could be expected from him over the next years?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://fljd.in/en/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Florent Jardin</author><guid>https://fljd.in/en/about/</guid><description>Discovery notebook from a DBA powered by passion and curiosity.
