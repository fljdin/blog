It is the event of the French PostgreSQL community that settles in a different city each year.
The opportunity was too good for me and I met many people from all over France and its surroundings,
to discuss PostgreSQL during two days of workshops and conferences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this edition, I had the pleasure of speaking and sharing my experience on the animation of
the local Meetup group that I took over four years ago. In this article, I want to write down the
main points discussed during this presentation, while waiting for the video of the conference to be
posted online.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
