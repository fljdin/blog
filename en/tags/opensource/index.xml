It is the event of the French PostgreSQL community that settles in a different city each year.
The opportunity was too good for me and I met many people from all over France and its surroundings,
to discuss PostgreSQL during two days of workshops and conferences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this edition, I had the pleasure of speaking and sharing my experience on the animation of
the local Meetup group that I took over four years ago. In this article, I want to write down the
main points discussed during this presentation, while waiting for the video of the conference to be
posted online.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On the road to freedom with db_migrator</title><link>https://fljd.in/en/2023/07/28/on-the-road-to-freedom-with-db_migrator/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://fljd.in/en/2023/07/28/on-the-road-to-freedom-with-db_migrator/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the past months, I have spent several weeks contributing to the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/db_migrator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">db_migrator&lt;/a> extension. Written solely in PL/pgSQL, it enables the migration of
schemas and data from a database system to PostgreSQL using the external data I
had presented &lt;a href="https://fljd-in.translate.goog/2021/07/16/parlons-un-peu-des-donnees-externes/?_x_tr_sl=fr&amp;amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;amp;_x_tr_hl=fr&amp;amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few years ago&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, I present the functionality of the tool, its philosophy, and
the reason I found for its existence, even though it joins the ecosystem of
well-established open-source projects in the migration landscape. How does it
compare to &lt;a href="https://ora2pg.darold.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ora2Pg&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://pgloader.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pgloader&lt;/a> in terms of value and capabilities?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
