but there are small singularities in the wild. In this regard, the <code>hierarchyid</code> data type
provided by SQL Server is a striking example. If you are switching to PostgreSQL, two
solutions are available to you.</p><p>A first and simpler solution consists in linking each node to its parent using a new
<code>parentid</code> column and applying a foreign key constraint. Another, more complete approach
consists in using the <code>ltree</code> extension. This article deals with the latter case.</p><small>» <a href=https://fljd.in/en/2024/09/19/hierarchical-data-types/>Read more</a></small></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://fljd.in/en/2024/07/30/how-to-keep-a-community-alive/>How to keep a community alive</a></h1><time datetime=2024-07-30 class=post-date>30 jul 2024</time><p>The <a href=https://pgday.fr/ target=_blank rel=noopener>PG Day France</a> took place on June 11th and 12th in Lille, my hometown.
It is the event of the French PostgreSQL community that settles in a different city each year.
The opportunity was too good for me and I met many people from all over France and its surroundings,
to discuss PostgreSQL during two days of workshops and conferences.</p><p>For this edition, I had the pleasure of speaking and sharing my experience on the animation of
the local Meetup group that I took over four years ago. In this article, I want to write down the
main points discussed during this presentation, while waiting for the video of the conference to be
posted online.</p><small>» <a href=https://fljd.in/en/2024/07/30/how-to-keep-a-community-alive/>Read more</a></small></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://fljd.in/en/2024/05/28/an-assistant-to-copy-data-from-a-remote-server/>An assistant to copy data from a remote server</a></h1><time datetime=2024-05-28 class=post-date>28 may 2024</time><p>During the last PGSession organized by Dalibo, I wrote and led a <a href=https://dali.bo/wsfdw_html target=_blank rel=noopener>workshop</a>
(french) on the migration to PostgreSQL using Foreign Data Wrappers, or FDW.
This was an opportunity to present to the general public the <a href=https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/db_migrator target=_blank rel=noopener><code>db_migrator</code></a>
extension for which I wrote an <a href=/en/2023/07/28/on-the-road-to-freedom-with-db_migrator/>article</a> on this blog.</p><p>While working on this workshop, we noticed that copying data with the
<code>db_migrator</code> extension is not perfectly supported. Indeed, although there is a
low-level function to distribute the transfer table by table over several
processes, many situations will require writing a large number of SQL queries to
get out of trouble. Over the following months, I worked on the design of an
<a href=https://github.com/fljdin/fdw-assistant target=_blank rel=noopener>assistant</a> written in PL/pgSQL whose purpose is to simplify the generation
of these queries.</p><small>» <a href=https://fljd.in/en/2024/05/28/an-assistant-to-copy-data-from-a-remote-server/>Read more</a></small></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://fljd.in/en/2023/11/11/transfer-modes-in-a-migration/>Transfer modes in a migration</a></h1><time datetime=2023-11-11 class=post-date>11 nov 2023</time><p>In computer science, a migration project involves changing one or more technical
components without impacting any application behaviors. In the realm of
databases (and the profession I practice), it will involve choosing a new system
(such as PostgreSQL) to replace another (such as Oracle or Microsoft SQL
Server).</p><p>In a <a href=/2021/12/06/migrer-vers-postgresql/>previous article</a> (French), I described exhaustive steps to perform a
complete migration using Foreign Data Wrappers technology. However, the critical
data transfer step described there does not suit all situations. Let&rsquo;s explore
together the alternatives that cover a large portion of the needs.</p><small>» <a href=https://fljd.in/en/2023/11/11/transfer-modes-in-a-migration/>Read more</a></small></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://fljd.in/en/2023/07/28/on-the-road-to-freedom-with-db_migrator/>On the road to freedom with db_migrator</a></h1><time datetime=2023-07-28 class=post-date>28 jul 2023</time><p>Over the past months, I have spent several weeks contributing to the
<a href=https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/db_migrator target=_blank rel=noopener>db_migrator</a> extension. Written solely in PL/pgSQL, it enables the migration of
schemas and data from a database system to PostgreSQL using the external data I
had presented <a href="https://fljd-in.translate.goog/2021/07/16/parlons-un-peu-des-donnees-externes/?_x_tr_sl=fr&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp" target=_blank rel=noopener>few years ago</a>.</p><p>In this post, I present the functionality of the tool, its philosophy, and
the reason I found for its existence, even though it joins the ecosystem of
well-established open-source projects in the migration landscape. How does it
compare to <a href=https://ora2pg.darold.net/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Ora2Pg</a> or <a href=https://pgloader.io/ target=_blank rel=noopener>pgloader</a> in terms of value and capabilities?</p><small>» <a href=https://fljd.in/en/2023/07/28/on-the-road-to-freedom-with-db_migrator/>Read more</a></small></article></div><div class=pagination><a class="pagination-item older" href=/en/page/2/>Previous page</a>
